# JavaFX UI test plan

Manual tests for Auto's JavaFX chat interface. Start a fresh application for
each test unless the test says otherwise.

Run the application with:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat run
```

## TC-00 Show startup greeting

1. Start the application.

Expected: The first Auto chat bubble immediately shows the ASCII Auto banner,
`Hello! I'm Auto, your task kaki.`, and `What you need to settle today?`.
The banner uses a monospace font, so its characters remain aligned as drawn.
Saved tasks have already been loaded before this message appears. If the data
file could not be loaded fully, the same welcome bubble also contains the load
warning below the greeting. Deadlines due today and events spanning today
appear below any warning under `Eh, remember these tasks for today (MMM dd yyyy):`.

## TC-01 Send with Enter

1. Type `todo read book` in the input field.
2. Press Enter.

Expected: The chat shows the user command followed by Auto's confirmation that
the todo was added. Each bubble shows its sender on a separately styled line
above the message. The user bubble is aligned right and Auto's bubble is aligned
left. The input field is cleared.

## TC-02 Send with the button

1. Type `list` in the input field.
2. Click **Send**.

Expected: Auto displays the task-list heading and the numbered `read book`
task. The input field is cleared.

## TC-03 Reject blank input

1. Leave the input field empty or enter only spaces.
2. Press Enter or click **Send**.

Expected: No chat messages are added.

## TC-04 Display an invalid command

1. Send `borrow book`.

Expected: Auto displays `Paiseh, I don't understand this command lah.` and the
application remains usable.

## TC-05 Preserve state between messages

1. Send `todo write essay`.
2. Send `mark 1`.
3. Send `list`.

Expected: The list shows task 1 as completed: `[T][X] write essay`.

## TC-06 Persist state between launches

1. Add a task and close the application.
2. Start the application again.
3. Send `list`.

Expected: The previously added task is restored from `data/auto.txt`.

## TC-07 Keep the newest message visible

1. Send enough commands to fill the chat history beyond the window height.

Expected: The history scrolls automatically so the newest response remains
visible.

## TC-08 Exit response

1. Send `bye`.

Expected: Auto processes the farewell and immediately closes the application
window after producing `Okay, bye lah! Go take a kopi break.`. The application
closes and the Gradle `run` task also finishes rather than remaining active in the
IDE. The farewell bubble may close before it is visibly rendered.

## TC-09 Show today's reminders on each launch

1. Using today's local date in dd/MM/yyyy format, add a todo, a deadline due
   today, and events starting today, ending today, and spanning today.
2. Add deadlines and events entirely before or after today.
3. Mark the deadline due today as completed, then close and reopen Auto.

Expected: The first welcome bubble includes `Eh, remember these tasks for today (MMM dd yyyy):`
with today's date. It lists the deadline and all three events, using their
original list numbers and normal task formatting, including the deadline's
`[X]` marker. The todo and tasks on other dates do not appear in reminders.
Reopening the application displays the reminders again without changing tasks.

## TC-10 Omit reminders when nothing occurs today

1. Start with an empty saved task list, or only todos and tasks on other dates.
2. Open Auto.

Expected: The normal welcome message appears without a reminders heading.

## TC-11 Show reminders alongside recovery warnings

1. Save a deadline due today, then close Auto.
2. Append a malformed line such as `not a task` to the saved data file.
3. Reopen Auto.

Expected: The welcome bubble shows a warning beginning
`Paiseh, some saved data cannot be read. 1 invalid data line(s) were skipped:`, then
a blank line and today's reminders, including the recovered deadline.

## TC-12 Use the task-kaki voice for normal commands

1. Start with an empty saved task list.
2. Send `todo read book`, then `list`, then `find book`.
3. Send `mark 1`, then `unmark 1`, then `delete 1`.
4. Send `deadline submit assignment /by 18/09/2026`.
5. Send `event study session /from 18/09/2026 /to 19/09/2026`.
6. Send `occur 18/09/2026`.

Expected: Each added task is introduced by `Can! Added this task for you:`.
The count reads `You now have N tasks on your list. Slowly clear, can one.`, with N equal
to the current total (1, 0 after deletion, then 1 and 2 for the dated tasks).
`list` starts with `Here's what you have on your plate:`; `find book` starts
with `Found these tasks for you:`. Both show `1. [T][ ] read book`.
`mark 1` starts with `Steady lah! Marked this task as done:` and shows
`[T][X] read book`. `unmark 1` starts with
`No worries, marked this as not done yet. Take your time lah:` and shows
`[T][ ] read book`. Deletion starts with `Can, removed this task already:`.
`occur` starts with `Here's what you have on Sep 18 2026:` and lists both
dated tasks using their original numbers and existing task formatting.

## TC-13 Explain command errors in the task-kaki voice

Start with an empty saved task list. Send each command below and check the
exact response. The application must remain usable after each error.

| Command | Expected response |
| --- | --- |
| `borrow book` | `Paiseh, I don't understand this command lah.` |
| `mark 1` | `Paiseh, no task 1 leh. Type list to check the numbers.` |
| `mark abc` | `Paiseh, 'abc' is not a task number lah. Use a whole number.` |
| `find` | `Paiseh, find what ah? Try find book.` |
| `deadline submit assignment` | `Paiseh, by when ah? Add /by followed by a date in dd/MM/yyyy.` |
| `event study session` | `Paiseh, when start, when end? Add /from and /to dates in dd/MM/yyyy.` |
| `event study /from 19/09/2026 /to 18/09/2026` | `Paiseh, end before start cannot lah. Check your /from and /to dates.` |
| `occur 31/02/2026` | `Paiseh, '31/02/2026' is not a valid date leh. Use dd/MM/yyyy.` |

Finally send `todo read book`, then `list`. The task is added normally and
appears as task 1, confirming the invalid commands did not add tasks.

## TC-14 Explain storage failures clearly

1. With Auto closed, temporarily move any existing `data/auto.txt` to a safe
   backup location and create a directory named `data/auto.txt` instead.
2. Launch Auto, then send `todo read book` and `list`.
3. Close Auto, remove the empty directory, and restore the original file.

Expected: The welcome bubble includes
`Paiseh, I couldn't load your saved tasks. Starting with an empty task list.`
Adding the task returns
`Paiseh, I couldn't save your tasks. Your latest change was not applied.`
The task list remains empty.
